# TextBasedNationBuilders
Text Based version of a [game](https://thediemer.itch.io/the-universe-hates-you-v1) that I worked on for a class during my senior year of college.

The game originally started as Nation Builders with lots of events being positive, building events. However, during the development, we encountered several issues with Unity Game engine that caused a lot of very unusual bugs including one that caused the planet that spins in the center of the screen to go spinning off the screen. After seeing several of these we decided to change the name to The Universe Hates You and the focus to be much more negative. Below is the description of the final result that we presented at the end of the semester:

The Universe Hates You is a part chance, part strategy planet management game, initially inspired by FTL: Faster Than Light. The game starts with choosing a specific leadership type that determines the starting default stats. Gameplay is broken up into "seasons." During each season, you have the chance to reallocate resources or respond to new developments. Because the universe is an unpredictable place, with each new season, a chance event occurs that may have significant impacts on your planet.

The effects of this event might be positive, but...probably not, because the universe hates you.

Whether belligerent extraterrestrials are taking interest in your developing world or the universe is straight up hurling giant space rocks at you, growing your young society will not be a walk in the park.

But with intelligent planning and decision-making, perhaps not even the whole spiteful universe can stop you.
